# mehhovcki Group Autoclaimer on Disnake,
or **workshop**, is second version of **ansel**, that is based on `disnake`, instead of `discord.py-self`. more easy to setup, than ansel ðŸ™„

# WARNING!
this version is abandoned, there may not be an update anytime soon; **workshop** is using a **very old** version of [**ansel**](https://github.com/mehh0vcki/group-autoclaimer), so it may be missing some features, fixes, etc. that [**ansel**](https://github.com/mehh0vcki/group-autoclaimer) has. if you encounter any problems using this version, you will need to fix them yourself.

## how do i install this?

<p align="center"> <img width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehh0vcki/group-autoclaimer/main/images/install.png" alt="installation button"> </p>

to run this, you need to have:
- [python](https://python.org)
    - recommended to install 3.12.2; this auto was written on it!

after you install everything, extract zip of autoclaimer in any folder *(do not put spaces in folder name! replace them with <b>_</b> or <b>-</b>!)*, and run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## what should i change to set up autoclaimer?

in `main.py`, on the line `163` *(or last one)*, put in empty quotes your discord's bot token. *(NOT USER ACCOUNT TOKEN!!)*

and in `cookies.txt` you should add your roblox cookie, also known as **.ROBLOSECURITY**.

you can understand, how to get [roblox cookie here](https://youtu.be/suMKl_KBFKQ)
